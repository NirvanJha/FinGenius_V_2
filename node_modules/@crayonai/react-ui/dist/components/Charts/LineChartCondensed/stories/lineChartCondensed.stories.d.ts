/**
 * # LineChartCondensed Component Documentation
 *
 * The LineChartCondensed is a compact version of LineChart, designed for space-constrained layouts
 * like dashboards and sidebars. It's ideal for:
 *
 * - **Compact Dashboards**: Showing multiple trends in limited space
 * - **Sidebar Analytics**: Quick trend visualization without taking up too much room
 * - **Dense Data Display**: Efficiently showing many data points in a small area
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Space-Efficient Design
 * - **Compact Height**: Default 200px height for tight layouts
 * - **Minimal Legend**: Legend is compact and doesn't take up vertical space
 * - **Adjustable Tick Variants**: Choose between horizontal or angled labels for better space usage
 *
 * ### Flexible Label Handling
 * - **Single Line Ticks**: Horizontal labels with automatic collision detection
 * - **Angled Ticks**: Optimal rotation angle for longer labels that need more space
 * - **Smart Angle Calculation**: Automatically calculates optimal rotation based on label width
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Standard tooltip showing all data series
 * - **Responsive Design**: Adapts fluidly to its container's size
 * - **Line Customization**: Control line thickness with strokeWidth prop
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Comes with six pre-built color palettes
 * - **Line Styles**: Supports `linear`, `natural` (smooth), and `step` interpolation
 * - **Styling Options**: Control grid visibility, axes, stroke width, and more

 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the LineChartCondensed component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Label Handling**: Datasets with long, dense, or overlapping labels.
 * - **Data Density**: Scenarios with few or many data points.
 * - **Tick Variants**: Toggle between horizontal and angled label orientations.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.
