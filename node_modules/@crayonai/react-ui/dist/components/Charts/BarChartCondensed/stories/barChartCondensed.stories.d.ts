/**
 * # BarChartCondensed Component Documentation
 *
 * The BarChartCondensed is a compact version of BarChart, designed for space-constrained layouts
 * like dashboards and sidebars. It's ideal for:
 *
 * - **Compact Dashboards**: Showing multiple metrics in limited space
 * - **Sidebar Analytics**: Quick comparison visualization without taking up too much room
 * - **Dense Data Display**: Efficiently showing many data points in a small area
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Space-Efficient Design
 * - **Compact Height**: Default 200px height for tight layouts
 * - **Minimal Legend**: Legend is compact and doesn't take up vertical space
 * - **Adjustable Tick Variants**: Choose between horizontal or angled labels for better space usage
 *
 * ### Layout Variants
 * - **Grouped**: Compare sub-categories side-by-side within a primary category
 * - **Stacked**: Show how sub-categories contribute to a total value
 *
 * ### Flexible Label Handling
 * - **Single Line Ticks**: Horizontal labels with automatic collision detection
 * - **Angled Ticks**: Optimal rotation angle for longer labels that need more space
 * - **Smart Angle Calculation**: Automatically calculates optimal rotation based on label width
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Standard tooltip showing all data series
 * - **Responsive Design**: Adapts fluidly to its container's size
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Comes with six pre-built color palettes
 * - **Bar Styling**: Customize corner radius with the radius prop
 * - **Styling Options**: Control grid visibility, axes, and more

 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the BarChartCondensed component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Label Handling**: Datasets with long, dense, or overlapping labels.
 * - **Data Density**: Scenarios with few or many data points.
 * - **Chart Variants**: Toggle between grouped and stacked layouts.
 * - **Tick Variants**: Toggle between horizontal and angled label orientations.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.
